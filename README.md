# Avoid-obstacles-python
> - for executing the code kindly download the robotic platform named VREP
> - from that run the .ttt file
> - all the connections are done internally via python
# How it works
> - the component created will automatically avoid all other obstacles and will crate an way by itself(this execution process can be seen only on vrep)
> - this is done with the help of python and vrep platforms
